<h2> SAALAR </H2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaar:_Part_1_%E2%80%93_Ceasefire" target="_blank">Saalar</a>
<P> "Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire" is a 2023 Indian Telugu-language action thriller directed by Prashanth Neel, starring Prabhas as Deva and Prithviraj Sukumaran as Vardharaja. The film, set in a fictional dystopian city-state called Khansaar, explores the complex friendship and eventual rivalry between the two characters against the backdrop of political intrigue and rebellion. The movie, which is part of a duology, is known for its high-octane action sequences, elaborate sets, and a storyline that delves into themes of power, brotherhood, and betrayal. <BR>
"Salaar" is heavily influenced by Neel's previous work, "K.G.F.", with a similar visual style and focus on a larger-than-life protagonist. The film's narrative spans multiple timelines and introduces a vast array of characters, including Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, and Sriya Reddy, among others. While the film is praised for its action choreography, cinematography, and background score, some critics have noted that the first half of the film spends considerable time establishing the characters and setting, leading to a somewhat slow burn.</P>

<H2> BAHUBALI </H2>
<a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baahubali:_The_Beginning" target="_blank">Bahubali</a>
<P>Baahubali: The Beginning is a 2015 Indian epic action film co-written and directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under Arka Media Works.

The film's story was written by Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad, who told him a story about Sivagami, a woman who carries a baby in her hand while crossing a river, and a few years later about Kattappa, which intrigued Rajamouli. His fascination with Mahabharata and the tales of Amar Chitra Katha and Chandamama further fueled his interest in the story. It took the writers three months to complete the final draft. The soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, while the cinematography, production design, and VFX were handled by K. K. Senthil Kumar, Sabu Cyril and V.
